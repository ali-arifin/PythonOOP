Everything in Python is an object. There are 4 basic principles for writing clean and concise code. These principles are called the 4 pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). These 4 pillars are **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.**

## Inheritance:
In inheritance, there is a parent class and a child class. A child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class. 

## Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

## Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation is the process of making data private by wrapping data and its methods in a ‘capsule’ or unit, so that it can not be accessed or modified outside of that unit. This is achieved by making variables inside a class private.

## Abstraction:
Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user.
